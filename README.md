## Hotel Revenue Dashboard
This project involved building an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize key hotel revenue metrics. The goal was to create a unified view of hotel performance across multiple dimensions to support data-driven decision making.

**Data Overview**
The data included hotel booking information such as booking dates, room rates, discount percentages, total revenue, and required parking spaces. Data was aggregated from multiple hotels over a multi-year period from 2018 to 2020.

**Dashboard Design**
Key visualizations included:

* Total revenue over time filtered by hotel
* Revenue by hotel in a pie chart
* Average daily rate as a card visualization
* Total nights booked as a KPI
* Average discount percentage as a KPI
* Table showing total revenue by reservation date and hotel
* Car parking spaces and percentages in a table
* The dashboard enables slicing data by date range, hotel, and country using filters. All visuals update interactively when filters are applied.

**Outcomes**
The hotel revenue dashboard consolidates multiple data sources into a unified view for gleaning insights. Trends and outliers can be identified visually. The tool enables interacting with the data to analyze performance by different dimensions. Future booking and rate decisions can be driven by data-based insights from the dashboard.
